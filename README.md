Render, 3D Model and composite images in pure python. 


I am writing this to learn 3D math. It is for fun and to be used
as a platform to teach 3D math and graphics. 

Inspired by years of working with Maya 3D and Houdini. 
I love the "ops" idea from houdini, everything is an operator and
you chain them together.



   Organized by the following modules:
   -  math_ops    - math, vectors, matrices, the core logic of it all  
   -  point_ops   - points, polygons, and objects, the "brains" of geometry processing
   -  obj3d       - data structure for 3D models. Inherits all the other stuff  
   -  raster_ops  - image manipulation with PIL, framebuffer  
   -  render      - brain dead simple 3D rendering, examples of using pygfx modules to build a 3D render  

   Example files are split up by type:
   -  examples            - examples of geometry processing
   -  examples_2d         - examples of 2D rendering and 2D vector processing 
   -  examples_render     - examples of 3D rendering 
   -  examples_selection  - examples of extracting portions of polygon geometry  
   -  examples_vector     - examples of 3D vector processing

   Stuff you can ignore for now :
   -  examples_wip - work in progess examples 
   -  unit_tests   - not done yet 
   -  raytrace     - someones code I imported and am considering intergrating 
   -  dag_ops      - directed acyclic graph, first stab at a scene graph (not working yet)
   -  grid_ops     - nothing here yet, future home of mapping and grids 
   -  examples_2d  - nothing here worth looking at  
   -  render_2d    - nothing here yet, future home of 2D rendering
